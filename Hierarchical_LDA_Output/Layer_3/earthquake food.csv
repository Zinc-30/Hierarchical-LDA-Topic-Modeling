We are broadcasting real time news from the disaster area. Recently, we have been complaining about unhappy messages about fellow Uyghurs left on social media platforms like Wechat, Microblog, and some websites. When we arrived in Hotan today, we were so impressed with our businessmen who were ready to spend their wealth for their own people who are experiencing a life of hardship. Now, we are posting our news from the Hotan Abide Food Company. According to what we learned from here, Uyghur businessmen and companies, including Meghrip Trading Company Ltd., Miras Clothing, Abide Company, Telba School, Ejrim Company, Yadikar Tea Products, Sadaqet Company, Qaydu Company, and other businessmen whose names we don't yet know, gave 20 metric tons of wheat flour, 700,000 Yuan in material aid, and a huge amount of cash. They departed from Abide Food Company in Hotan, ready to deliver the material aide to their people in the disaster area. We will try to do our best to post real time news regularly from the disaster area, if Allah wills... The world is beautiful with love and caring. We wish our businessmen successful business and prosperity."
