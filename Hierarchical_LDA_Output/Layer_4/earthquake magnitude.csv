People in the Keriya Red Cross Organization were responsible for receiving donated material aid and cash on behalf of the people in the disaster area. Maybe only small numbers of people were able to reach the disaster area because of unexpected quakes. Later, the local government appointed the Civil Affairs Bureau to be responsible for that. The Civil Affairs Bureau officials provided information about the situation of the disaster area to the people who brought donations, and they took some donors to the earthquake zone for distributing material aid if they wanted to go to the area. Following the growing of donors in number gradually, they all brought their donations to Atchan village directly. So all the donations were simply gathered in Atchan village. After proper arrangements were made for the affected villages nearby, the local government planned to accept donations on behalf of some heavily affected villages in remote mountainous areas that the donors were not able to reach and to bring them to the affected people for their share. After learning this, the donors entrusted this to the Civil Affairs Bureau, and they will take you to the earthquake zone if you want to bring your donations by yourself. Some people in the disaster area wanted more donations after the government distributed some cash and material aid to them. They still complained about the local officials saying they did not give some donations to the people and what they said really confused some people. The government did not take anything that belonged to you, dear brothers and sisters ... think about that, what will be the influence of the rumors that the donations were not delivered?"

Here houses were adjacent to each other and the area is heavily populated, in addition to the existence of numerous old houses. For this reason, it's easy to say that some houses in this area might have been damaged by the quake. If so, what types of houses are they? Simply say, they are the houses that were damaged during the quake. The most shocking factor is the age of the houses. Some of them might be 50 to 60 years old while some of the newest ones would be 8 years old. There still might be some houses that are about 5 years old."
