We are broadcasting real time news from the disaster area. Recently, we have been complaining about unhappy messages about fellow Uyghurs left on social media platforms like Wechat, Microblog, and some websites. When we arrived in Hotan today, we were so impressed with our businessmen who were ready to spend their wealth for their own people who are experiencing a life of hardship. Now, we are posting our news from the Hotan Abide Food Company. According to what we learned from here, Uyghur businessmen and companies, including Meghrip Trading Company Ltd., Miras Clothing, Abide Company, Telba School, Ejrim Company, Yadikar Tea Products, Sadaqet Company, Qaydu Company, and other businessmen whose names we don't yet know, gave 20 metric tons of wheat flour, 700,000 Yuan in material aid, and a huge amount of cash. They departed from Abide Food Company in Hotan, ready to deliver the material aide to their people in the disaster area. We will try to do our best to post real time news regularly from the disaster area, if Allah wills... The world is beautiful with love and caring. We wish our businessmen successful business and prosperity."

We have reached Keriye county, and are going on our trip to the affected region. Recently, people on Wechat complained and argued about both a Turkish singer and the people who spread news about this singer, which made Wechat a battling site. Since yesterday, the comments on Mis Ra Nim web had started to blame Xinjiang TV Station for spreading that news. Everyone has turned their attention to the earthquake, and we have left for there. We criticized our entrepreneurs, but they also left for the affected region this morning. So those complaints have vanished. Following that, we started to blame those who had not reached the site. According to the information given by the youth, some young people and companies will reach the site tomorrow morning. And then, some people are still blaming them. But in fact, those companies are helping the victims. Now we've started to blame the people who are on their way to the disaster site. We sincerely hope that our friends' diseases are cured as soon as possible. If God allows, we will arrive at the affected region to report the situation in the next two days. We appeal to our friends to spread the solidarity and kindness, not rumors, on our Uyghur's Wechat moment. Thanks."
