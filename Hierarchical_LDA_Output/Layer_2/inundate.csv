People in the Keriya Red Cross Organization were responsible for receiving donated material aid and cash on behalf of the people in the disaster area. Maybe only small numbers of people were able to reach the disaster area because of unexpected quakes. Later, the local government appointed the Civil Affairs Bureau to be responsible for that. The Civil Affairs Bureau officials provided information about the situation of the disaster area to the people who brought donations, and they took some donors to the earthquake zone for distributing material aid if they wanted to go to the area. Following the growing of donors in number gradually, they all brought their donations to Atchan village directly. So all the donations were simply gathered in Atchan village. After proper arrangements were made for the affected villages nearby, the local government planned to accept donations on behalf of some heavily affected villages in remote mountainous areas that the donors were not able to reach and to bring them to the affected people for their share. After learning this, the donors entrusted this to the Civil Affairs Bureau, and they will take you to the earthquake zone if you want to bring your donations by yourself. Some people in the disaster area wanted more donations after the government distributed some cash and material aid to them. They still complained about the local officials saying they did not give some donations to the people and what they said really confused some people. The government did not take anything that belonged to you, dear brothers and sisters ... think about that, what will be the influence of the rumors that the donations were not delivered?"

They have suffered and see a lot. The most important thing is their passion for charity work had been increased. If you get the chance to hear their feeling, it would be like a thanksgiving lesson. This is not the end for the One Yuan Plan works in Bostan village. We have paid 3 families 21,000 Yuan to found earthquake resistance buildings. Until now in Börtala we has funded 35,000 Yuan for 5 families among 9 families in Kiriye.

The prayers, phones, Wechat messages and text messages for friends'safety, which are from people who live in other parts of Xinjiang, reached Kiriye. I believe that every Uyghur who see this news has prayed for their safety. From the evening on Feb 12, in the Uyghur's land the spontaneous entrepreneurs, businessmen, teachers, students whether they are enrolled or graduated from college, communities, writers, poets, farmers and herdsmen expressed their sincere feelings and greetings from their hometowns towards the victims. Some places in Kiriye County, such as Atchan village, were full of vehicles with supplies. Today, Feb 19, there are still so many vehicles stopping by the government building in order to distribute their supplies to the victims. A car full of rice was carried by a farmer family of seven members from Qaraqash, who were aged from 20 to 70. During our conversation, the eldest member told us that they couldn't sleep because of the earthquake in Kiriye, therefore they decided to check this out. What a touching word! How united we are! You should be very proud of being a Uyghur."

The warm sunshine is making people feel warm, prosperous and peaceful. The 10 representatives of the Philanthropist Fathers Collective of the Urumqi Charity Association who just travelled more than 800 kilometers distance from Urumqi have arrived in Tokkuztara county to express their sympathy to all people in the disaster area of Tokkuztara county.

We left for Künes village and Shunggul village after we got the information that the supplies had not been delivered because of the dangerous road conditions there. Our goal is to help the people who need those supplies. Indeed, the road toward these two villages was so dangerous that it took nearly 4 hours to travel 60 kilometers of road. Luckily, the guys who welcomed us in Hoten prepared a SUV for this trip. You can't hold your tears when you see elderly people, so like your own grandparents, burst into grateful tears while they accept donation of money and supplies. We delivered 10,000 Yuan cash, and supplies worth 5000 Yuan, and 150 new clothes. (We were informed of the lack of supplies according to people who had been in the scene of earthquake, so we bought supplies from city.) We returned to the county at 10 o'clock that night."

Here houses were adjacent to each other and the area is heavily populated, in addition to the existence of numerous old houses. For this reason, it's easy to say that some houses in this area might have been damaged by the quake. If so, what types of houses are they? Simply say, they are the houses that were damaged during the quake. The most shocking factor is the age of the houses. Some of them might be 50 to 60 years old while some of the newest ones would be 8 years old. There still might be some houses that are about 5 years old."

Aas far as we knew, some residents' houses were in a really dangerous situation. Although the Earthquake resistant houses building policy had been well implemented, some peasants still couldn't afford the bills they were required to pay, so they missed this benefit of that policy. After our careful investigation, we narrowed our target down to 12 families. Among them, we chose 3 families to pay 7 thousand, for a total of 21 thousand, and signed the guarantee letter and contract with the village officials by entering these three families into the township yearly plan. These houses will be finished after 7 months. I am incapable of describing the happiness of those 3 families."
