But if you are familiar with the personality of the Uyghur, especially the Hoten's Uyghur, you can guess that it's difficult for them to go personally and pick up the donations from the government--out of their pride, and their unwillingness to beg for help. As we seen from the TV, usually the affected area is full of victims who are eating and living together in many shelter tents; but here, even though we're in the most affected area, you can't see more then 10 tents. If fresh polo was made by one of our people, it would be leftover because of the trouble in gathering enough people to eat it. It's commonly agreed that if supply exceeds need, people become lazy. But the victims need our help. What they need most right now is financial aid. The affected area, with its poor villages, need a financial guarantee to continue their normal production and daily life. We suggest people who can donate help the poor villages. We would be truly happy if helping hands reached the places that need them most. One more thing:, due to the already heavy supply, if further donations are sent, people should fill out the form shown in the picture. It's hard to deliver the personal donation to the government. We just heard the local school driver, Rawan in Hotan, is on his way to do the formal paperwork to donate 30 tons of coal. A lot of donations have been collected in the Urumqi. If it's not too much trouble for you, we suggest distributing donations house by house. You may face some trouble if you provide personal donations without a responsible person or company name. It's not difficult to feel the blessing of Allah toward our hometown, giving us the opportunity to deliver our love and care. Although, if the situation was as bad as they say over the net, there would be no time for paperwork, and we would not stand still without helping the victims. As a reporter from a private organization, I have been reporting the things I have seen without extra details. May happiness always be upon the kind people. Those who weren't able to be in the affected area personally, please donate your money to the people in need. As long as your goal is not to come here and take pictures, your donation can help the people needing medical treatment and education , and not necessarily the healthy people living in the affected area. The unrevealing part can be figured out by our people. May Allah bless all of us.",Others,,,

Then, we left for the affected regions, with the donation from our companies, Abida and Miras, as well as the microphones, provided by websites including Misranim, Anatuprak, Karwan, and Qimbulak. Certainly, this place is more than 50 kilometers away from Kiriye. We successfully delivered the food and clothes to the victims. The magnitude of 7.3 in the report is really high; however, thankfully, Allah has blessed our town and given this miracle. We knew from the Aqqang Township government that no one was injured, and only some houses were toppled. Of course, this is due to the fact that the earthquake occurred in a sparsely populated rural region. A rockslide damaged 150,000Mu of grassland, which caused 319 livestock to be killed. The pictures you saw on Wechat in recent days are from the most seriously damaged place. In total, there are only 10 pictures. We know that the reports from news agencies from the Central government and the Autonomous Region are from those pictures. However, some people on the Internet have posted pictures from the previous year's earthquake, giving wrong information. What you have seen here is the real condition of Uyghur people in this rural area. They are too poor to assemble donations. People who came here to assist these victims also updated with live reports. Now I want to say, please collect donations based on their need. We really need the necessary supplies. The victims are living in emergency tents, and because the affected region is in the mountains, they need coal for warming. Because so much land has been damaged, they need fodder for their herds too. Please remember to visit the poor Uyghur people in rural areas regardless of any excuse. I wish someone could collect money to cover the volunteers' travelling expenses. In this way, we could spend money on other poor Uyghur people in other rural areas, because this is a sparsely populated region, whose area is very large. Even if you reach here, you would not know where to find them. We are touched by people's motivations, reflecting a united spirit that says that, if one side is in trouble, the other sides will come to help. So, I advise those hesitating to come, think carefully. Accordingly, the current supplies and donations from our enterprisers and the government have exceeded expectations. ...... May Allah keep you all healthy ...... Ababakri Muhtar, reported from Misranim: an affected region, not a disaster region. May peace be up on you, my friends. I'm representing Misranim, Anatuprak, Qimbulak and Karwan websites to give a live report regarding to the condition of the affected regions. As I said at the beginning, words like ""disaster region"" in articles undoubtedly shocked everyone. A disaster region is an unfortunate place we don't want to visit. The correct term should be ""an affected region."" Please pay attention to your word usage. This morning, after a conversation with the leader of Keriye County, I found out that, since yesterday evening, many friends have delivered fodder and coal for the victims. Even the supplies from the government have exceeded the people's needs. I suggest other friends not come here, as other media have reported, because this situation is not as bad as it sounds. But still, with Allah's mercy, I am sad, having seen our friends' poverty. The people, who are already poor, attract our attention after this earthquake. God know how many poor families like them are existing in Xinjiang. After all, distributing the donated supplies has become a problem. Many charities are raising donations now, but the families live far away from each other. Under the circumstances, it is almost impossible to deliver the supplies to them.
