# Hierarchical-LDA-Topic-Modeling
Created the Hierarchical LDA topic modeling algorithms based on penalized average cosine similarity algorithms


Implement the Hierarchical LDA topic modeling algorithmsc based on penalized avergae coisine similarity methods created by Yuxiang Hou  

Problem desciption- LDA topic modeling algroithm always have a hard time to get the number of topic.This Algorithm will automatically get the correct number of topics based on average cosine similarity.
